"""Age-adjusted relative value — is this condo cheap or dear *for its age*?

Comparing a 10-year-old condo's PSF directly against a new launch is unfair:
new launches carry a freshness premium that decays with age.

v3.7: the decay is MEASURED and PIECEWISE (district-FE hedonic on 16.6k recent
leasehold resales — see config.AGE_PSF_DECAY_SEGMENTS): ~3%/yr (≈$50/psf/yr)
for the first 10 years, a 10–15yr plateau, a second leg down at 15–20, then a
slow drift. Adjustment is multiplicative in log space, so it scales with each
peer's own PSF level (no per-region $ constants needed).

This module normalizes every peer project's PSF to the subject's age using
that curve, then asks two questions:

1. vs the area: is the subject priced above or below the age-adjusted median
   of its district peers? (premium_vs_age_adjusted_median_pct — negative
   means cheap for its age)
2. vs new launches: given what new launches transact at in this district,
   what *should* the subject cost after age depreciation, and how does its
   asking PSF compare? (premium_vs_new_launch_implied_pct)

Peer data comes from the URA cache (per-project median transacted PSF +
lease-start year + district), i.e. real transactions, not asking prices.

⚠ The freehold factor is still a heuristic (freehold age isn't derivable from
URA tenure strings). Re-measure the curve via backtest_ext PART 1c.
