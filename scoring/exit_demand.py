"""The exit-demand lens — "always think about exit first: who buys from you,
why, at what price" (Eric Chiew's framework, distilled from 15 transcribed
videos), scored per project from URA resale history.

WHAT IT MEASURES. A project-level composite of the three Chiew criteria the
validation harness could test (validation/algos.py, exit_* entries):

  * pair record (weight .5) — Laplace-smoothed share of the project's pseudo
    repeat-sales pairs that exited at a profit. His #1 criterion, and the
    DE-CORRELATED core: rank rho vs psf_vs_dist is -0.06 on the DEV panel,
    and this whole lens correlates only +0.18 with stored score_1000 across
    the 5,078 live listings it can score — it ranks on an axis MMR does not
    see, which is the reason a second lens exists (scoring/lenses.py).
    External cross-check: rho +0.77 (n=21) against realsmart's true
    pct_profitable for the projects both sides cover.
  * family mix (weight .3) — share of resale stock at >= 900 sqft; penalises
    the 1-2BR "investor projects" he flags as exit-thin.
  * boutique flag (weight .2) — his worst combination: < 250 units AND
    freehold AND sub-750sqft median unit.

VALIDATION VERDICT — read before trusting a score. Measured 2026-08-01
(validation/run.py, ledger data/validation_results.csv): DEV rho +0.159
[+0.045,+0.255] significant; VAL +0.070 [-0.063,+0.232] not significant,
against a psf_vs_dist bar of +0.221/+0.066. It does NOT beat single-feature
cheapness in-split and nothing (bar included) is significant on VAL — the
lens is registered as NEUTRAL-AND-DECORRELATED, never as "better": its job
is to nominate exit records MMR structurally dislikes, not to outrank MMR.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT OUT.
  * Recent-volume (his #2): measured null as a raw count (DEV -0.017,
    VAL +0.098, ns) and significantly INVERTED per unit (-0.092 DEV) —
    reported in components as context, paid no weight.
  * Listing scarcity (his #3): no historical ground truth exists to validate
    it, and our live listing counts come from a scrape scope that most
    recently covered OCR 3-4BR only — "listings per 100 units" off that book
    is systematically undercounted for 1-2BR-heavy projects. An unvalidatable
    number with a known bias does not belong in a scored composite.
  * Age-adjusted comparable psf (his #5): measured null (DEV +0.043, ns).

VERSIONING. Calibration lives HERE and nowhere else — never in config.py,
which is sha-hashed into score_version and would restamp all 9,029 stored
scores (see scoring/lenses.py VERSIONING). version() fingerprints this file;
bump _VERSION_PREFIX on intentional recalibration.
