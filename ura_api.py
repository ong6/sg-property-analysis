"""URA data through the official API (via sgprop), no browser.

Replaces the headed-browser downloads in fetch_ura_districts.py and
fetch_ura_rentals.py. sgprop (github.com/ong6/sgprop) syncs every private
residential sale (5 yrs) and rental contract into its own store in ~40 s, then
writes the SAME per-district CSVs the browser produced, so every parser here
(parse_ura_csv, build_rental_cache, bed_bands) reads them unchanged.

Verified 2026-09-24: API transactions matched the eservice CSVs row for row
(D19 9,724/9,724, D20 2,669/2,669). The eservice rental CSV was silently
capped at 10,000 rows per district (D19 has 18,004 in the same window), so
rental medians and bed bands were built on a truncated sample until this.

The key never lives in this (public) repo: sgprop reads URA_ACCESS_KEY from
the environment or ~/.config/sgprop/credentials.

    python ura_api.py                 # sync + export + rebuild all caches
    python ura_api.py --check         # is the API path usable here?
